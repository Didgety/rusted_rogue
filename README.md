# Rusted Rogue

### Jai Veilleux

---

A small roguelike program featuring procedural map generation written entirely in rust

A work in progress, and sandbox of sorts for me to play with different algorithms and techniques

## Required Software

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Running the Program

- From the rusted_rogue folder:
  - `cargo build --release` builds the binary with all optimizations
  - `cargo run --release` runs the binary you just built

## References

- [RLTK](https://crates.io/crates/rltk)
